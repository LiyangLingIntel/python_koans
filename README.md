# Python Koans

This is a copy from [Python Koan](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) as Flex Python learning practise.

The original `README.rst` file is moved to [TUTORIAL.rst](./TUTORIAL.rst).

Here will record my progress on this repo test cases and [RealPython](https://realpython.com/quizzes/) quizzes.
